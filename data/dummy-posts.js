Lightly coat the cutlets in flour then dip into the egg, and finally, coat in breadcrumbs. Heat the butter and oil in a large pan (allow the fat to get very hot) and fry the schnitzels until golden brown on both sides. Make sure to toss the pan regularly so that the schnitzels are surrounded by oil and the crumbing becomes ‘fluffy’. Remove, and drain on kitchen paper. Fry the parsley in the remaining oil and drain. Place the schnitzels on awarmed plate and serve garnishedwith parsley and slices of lemon.'

      'Preheat oven to 190°C. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Brush bottom and sides of 2 ramekins lightly with 1 teaspoon melted butter; cover bottom and sides right up to the rim. Add 1 tablespoon white sugar to ramekins. Rotate ramekins until sugar coats all surfaces. Place chocolate pieces in a metal mixing bowl. Place bowl over a pan of about 3 cups hot water over low heat. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour. Whisk until flour is incorporated into butter and mixture thickens. Whisk in cold milk until mixture becomes smooth and thickens. Transfer mixture to bowl with melted chocolate. Add salt and cayenne pepper. Mix together thoroughly. Add egg yolk and mix to combine. Leave bowl above the hot (not simmering) water to keep chocolate warm while you whip the egg whites. Place 2 egg whites in a mixing bowl; add cream of tartar. Whisk until mixture begins to thicken and a drizzle from the whisk stays on the surface about 1 second before disappearing into the mix. Add 1/3 of sugar and whisk in. Whisk in a bit more sugar about 15 seconds. whisk in the rest of the sugar. Continue whisking until mixture is about as thick as shaving cream and holds soft peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer a little less than half of egg whites to chocolate. Mix until egg whites are thoroughly incorporated into the chocolate. Add the rest of the egg whites; gently fold into the chocolate with a spatula, lifting from the bottom and folding over. Stop mixing after the egg white disappears. Divide mixture between 2 prepared ramekins. Place ramekins on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until scuffles are puffed and have risen above the top of the rims, 12 to 15 minutes.'
